We have different fastx parser write in rust, this one was originaly create to be include in [noodles](https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles) but it's not fit in noodles crates target ([it's ok he convinced me](https://github.com/zaeleus/noodles/pull/73)).

## Usage

Add this in Cargo.toml dependency:
```
fastx = { git = "https://github.com/natir/fastx" }
```

No plans to add it to crates.io at this time.

## Minimum supported Rust version

Currently the minimum supported Rust version is 1.56.0.

## Evaluate parser

### Criterion

Requirement:
- [cargo criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/cargo-criterion)

```
cargo criterion
```

A html report is generate in `../target/criterion/reports/index.html`

### Hyperfine

Requirement:
- [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/)
- [seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk)
- a fastq file

Next script assume FASTQ variable contain path to fastq file.

```
cargo build --release --example fastq2fasta
hyperfine --warmup 3 -n fastx -n seqtk 'target/release/examples/fastq2fasta $FASTQ ' 'seqtk seq -A $FASTQ '
```
